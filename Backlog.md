# BACKLOG #

####Backlog: List of Features to be added in the future####

* PDF formatting: Currently, the PDF output is just the list of questions, but it would be more beneficial if it could be formatted in a way that creates spaces between the questions so the user can enter in their information 
* Expanding the app outside of Duke: The App currently was designed to be Duke specific since its a proof of concept but because the data sheet has a lot of other insurance provider data, the app could be extrapolated further 
* Conversation Guideline: Adding questions from other doctors/health financial advisors so the guide can cover a wider range of questions
* Machine Learning Applications: This is really far back on the backlog but one cool feature could be having patients come back and rate the accuracy of their timeline and then having the timeline algorithim account for past data to create more accurate models
