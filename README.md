A web application that calculates out-of-pocket treatment costs for cancer patients.\\

CS 408 project documents (e.g. executive summary) can be found in the "project_docs" directory.\\

## Notes

This project uses Vue Material, which was in beta at the time of CostCoach's production. The documentation claims that the API will not change, but this should be noted nonetheless.
